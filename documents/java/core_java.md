## Explain JRE, JDK and JVM

### **JDK (Java Development Kit)**

---

JDK is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things

* Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
* JRE (to execute your java program).

### **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**

---

JRE is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not to develop) the java program(or application) onto your machine.

### **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**

---

* JVM is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
* Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and
* JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.

## **JVM (Java Virtual Machine) Architecture**

---

* JVM is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
* Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and
* JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.

The JVM performs the following main tasks:

* Loads code
* Verifies code
* Executes code
* Provides runtime environment

JVM Architecture in Java : There are three main subsystems in JVM Architecture:

1. ClassLoader
2. Memory Area
3. Execution Engine

![](../../images/core_java/jvm_model.webp)

### Classloader

Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader.
There are three built-in classloaders in Java.

#### Bootstrap ClassLoader:

* Super class of Extension classloader.
* It loads the rt.jar file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like
  * java.lang package classes,
  * java.net package classes,
  * java.util package classes,
  * java.io package classes,
  * java.sql package classes etc.

#### Extension ClassLoader:

* This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader.
* It loads the jar files located inside $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory.

#### System/Application ClassLoader:

* This is the child classloader of Extension classloader.
* It loads the class files from classpath.
* By default, classpath is set to current directory.
* You can change the classpath using "-cp" or "-classpath" switch.
* It is also known as Application classloader.

```
Note: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException
JVM follows the Delegation-Hierarchy principle to load classes. 
System class loader delegate load request to extension class loader 
  and extension class loader delegate request to the bootstrap class loader. 
If a class found in the boot-strap path, the class is loaded otherwise 
  request again transfers to the extension class loader 
  and then to the system class loader. 
At last, if the system class loader fails to load class, 
  then we get run-time exception java.lang.ClassNotFoundException.
```

**Three important functions of ClassLoader are** :

#### Loading

This operation loads files from secondary memory into the main memory (RAM) for execution.

* Method area:
  * In the method area, all class level information like class name, immediate parent class name, methods and variables information etc. are stored, including static variables.
  * There is only one method area per JVM, and it is a shared resource.
* Heap area:
  * Information of all objects is stored in the heap area.
  * There is also one Heap Area per JVM.
  * It is also a shared resource.
* Stack area:
  * For every thread, JVM creates one run-time stack which is stored here.
  * Every block of this stack is called activation record/stack frame which stores methods calls.
  * All local variables of that method are stored in their corresponding frame.
  * After a thread terminates, its run-time stack will be destroyed by JVM.
  * It is not a shared resource.
* Program Counter (PC) Registers:
  * Store address of current execution instruction of a thread. PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.
  * Obviously, each thread has separate PC Registers.
* Native method stacks:
  * For every thread, a separate native stack is created.
  * It stores native method information.

#### Linking

Performs verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution.

* Verification:

  It ensures the correctness of the .class file i.e. it checks whether this file is properly formatted and generated by a valid compiler or not. If verification fails, we get run-time exception java.lang.VerifyError. This activity is done by the component ByteCodeVerifier. Once this activity is completed then the class file is ready for compilation.
* Preparation:

  JVM allocates memory for class variables and initializing the memory to default values.
* Resolution:

  It is the process of replacing symbolic references from the type with direct references. It is done by searching into the method area to locate the referenced entity.

#### Initialization

In this phase, all static variables are assigned with their values defined in the code and static block(if any). This is executed from top to bottom in a class and from parent to child in the class hierarchy.

### Execution Engine

* Execution engine executes the .class (bytecode).
* It reads the byte-code line by line, uses data and information present in various memory area and executes instructions.
* It has three major components namely a
  * virtual processor,
  * an interpreter,

    * Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
  * JIT compiler.

    * It is used to increase the efficiency of an interpreter.
    * It compiles the entire bytecode and changes it to native code so whenever the interpreter sees repeated method calls, JIT provides direct native code for that part so re-interpretation is not required, thus efficiency is improved.

### Java Native Interface (JNI) :

* It is an interface that interacts with the Native Method Libraries and provides the native libraries(C, C++) required for the execution.
* It enables JVM to call C/C++ libraries and to be called by C/C++ libraries which may be specific to hardware.

### Native Method Libraries :

* It is a collection of the Native Libraries(C, C++) which are required by the Execution Engine.
