| The collection is considered as the root interface of the collection framework. It provides several classes and interfaces to represent a group of individual objects as a single unit. | It defines several utility methods like sorting and searching which is used to operate on collection. It has all static methods. |
| Since Java 8, the Collection is an interface with a static function. Abstract and default methods can also be found in the Interface.                                                   | It only has static methods in it.                                                                                                |
