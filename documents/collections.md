# Collections

## Difference Collection and collections in the context of Java


| Collection                                                                                                                                                                               | Collections                                                                                                                      |

| Collection is a interface present in java.util.package                                                                                                                                   | Collections is a utility class present in java.util.package                                                                      |
| The collection is considered as the root interface of the collection framework. It provides several classes and interfaces to represent a group of individual objects as a single unit. | It defines several utility methods like sorting and searching which is used to operate on collection. It has all static methods. |
| Since Java 8, the Collection is an interface with a static function. Abstract and default methods can also be found in the Interface.                                                   | It only has static methods in it.                                                                                                |

## Hierarchy of the Collection framework

The entire collection framework hierarchy is made up of four fundamental interfaces: Collection, List, Set, Map, and two specific interfaces for sorting called SortedSet and SortedMap.

The java.util package contains all of the collection framework's interfaces and classes. The following diagram depicts the Java collection structure.
